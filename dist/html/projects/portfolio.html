Also, younger I was a big fan of MMO/MMORPG games so it's probably also explaining a lot <img src="../../assets/content/xd.png" alt="xd">.<br> Then, as Javascript is the language I feel the most comfortable with, I decided to give a try to Three.js.<br><br> As I was a complete newbie to 3d, it was a sort of half-step out of my comfort zone.<br><br> <p style="text-decoration:underline">Design/art</p><br> Most of the art come from OpenGameArte, Mixamo or SketchFab. TurboSquid and Blender Swap are also nice are exchange platforms<br> I used Blender to tune/reshape the models that I found on the internet to make them exploitable in Three.js.<br><br> <p style="text-decoration:underline">Development</p><br> I started by browsing the Internet to find some interesting models to make the world I had in mind.<br><br> One of my first decision to make was wether it should be a <b>3rd or 1st person view</b> (does the user see its character or not ?). I decided to go for a 3rd person as I thought it would be more interesting to impersonate a character but it's purely a personal choice.<br> Then I defined the movement and animations of the character. I found very helpful the videos and repos of <a href="https://github.com/simondevyoutube">this retired game developer</a>.<br><br> After that I had to "make" the environment by placing, rotating, scaling, all the models.<br> There comes the second biggest challenge and probably the hardest one for me to solve in this project was <b>collision detection</b> with the environement. Especially what happens when the character goes beyond the edge of the island ? <br> Well you can try and you will certainly fall and die. <br> However this wasn't that obvious to code as I had to map each part of the island with planes and triangles and check the intersection of these elements with the hitbox of the character, which I defined with using <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Box3">THREE.Box3</a> by the way.<br> It internally uses an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection">AABB</a> algo to check wether an object is "touching" another object in 3d or 2d.<br><br> Finally I worked on the treasure chest with its animations and the cube that let's you read those lines.<br><br> <p style="text-decoration:underline">Production</p><br> To produce a production build of the app I used <a href="https://webpack.js.org">Webpack5</a>. In my configuration it bundles all the JS and minifies the CSS/HTML for better performances.<br> As it's a static web page, it doesn't use any database so <b>Github Pages</b> appeared to be an easy hosting solution for this app.<br><br> <p style="text-decoration:underline">Challenges</p><br> Almost every part of this project was extremely challenging as I had a very short amount of time to learn Three.js (<a href="https://threejsfundamentals.org">which I almost entirely did thanks to this amazing tutorial</a>), get in touch with 3d, Blender, animations in which I had almost zero knowledge…<br> I'm glad though that I was doing well in math classes in earlier courses because 3d happens to be full of trigonometry <img src="../../assets/content/grinning.png" alt="grinning">.<br> But I learnt so much from it and understood the very basics of how 3d games are made.<br><br> I haven't been able to keep up with all the challenges as this app is absolutely not a fit for small devices such as mobile phones. I focused only on laptop/desktop devices so responsiveness and performance related issues will probably be encountered. <p></p> </div> <script>let slideIndex=1;function plusSlides(e){showSlides(slideIndex+=e)}function currentSlide(e){showSlides(slideIndex=e)}function showSlides(e){let l=document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides"),s=document.getElementsByClassName("dot");e>l.length&&(slideIndex=1),e<1&&(slideIndex=l.length);for(let e=0;e<l.length;e++)l[e].style.display="none";for(let e=0;e<s.length;e++)s[e].className=s[e].className.replace(" active","");l[slideIndex-1].style.display="block",s[slideIndex-1].className+=" active"}showSlides(slideIndex)</script> </body> </html>
