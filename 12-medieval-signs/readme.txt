12 Medieval Signs

So many RPGs have buildings and shops you pretty much have to enter to find out what they are.  In the real medieval and modern world signs are used to solve that problem.  These signs are simple, images, so:

1) they can be used for various purposes, and
2) they make sense for a semi-literate society,
3) they can be recognized by the player at a distance
