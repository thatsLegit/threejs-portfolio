                    In december 2020, I decided to make a portfolio project for several reasons:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A cv is too short and doesn't tell much about the skills</li>
                        <li>As a web developer, I felt like I should probably do a website for fun to present all my work done as a student</li>
                        <li>You can do whatever you want in it</li>
                        <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">I had too much free time</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Why 3d ?</p><br>
                    I always had this childish dream to be able to create an open virtual world in which I could create my own rules and code whatever I wanted.
                    Also, younger I was a big fan of MMO/MMORPG games so it's probably also explaining a lot <img src=${xd} alt="xd">.<br>
                    Then, as Javascript is the language I feel the most comfortable with, I decided to give a try to Three.js.<br><br>
                    As I was a complete newbie to 3d, it was a sort of half-step out of my comfort zone.<br><br>
                    
                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Design/art</p><br>
                    Most of the art come from OpenGameArt, Mixamo or SketchFab. TurboSquid and Blender Swap are also nice are exchange platforms<br>
                    I used Blender to tune/reshape the models that I found on the internet to make them exploitable in Three.js.<br><br>

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Development</p><br>
                    I started by browsing the Internet to find some interesting models to make the world I had in mind.<br><br>

                    One of my first decision to make was wether it should be a <b>3rd or 1st person view</b> (does the user see its character or not ?).
                    I decided to go for a 3rd person as I thought it would be more interesting to impersonate a character but it's purely a personal choice.<br>
                    Then I defined the movement and animations of the character. I found very helpful the videos and repos of <a href=${this.simonDevYoutubeChannel}>this retired game developer</a>.<br><br>

                    After that I had to "make" the environment by placing, rotating, scaling, all the models.<br>
                    There comes the second biggest challenge and probably the hardest one for me to solve in this project was <b>collision detection</b> with the environement.
                    Especially what happens when the character goes beyond the edge of the island ? <br> 
                    Well you can try and you will certainly fall and die. <br>
                    However this wasn't that obvious to code as I had to map each part of the island with planes and triangles and check the intersection of these elements with the hitbox of the character, 
                    which I defined with using <a href=${this.box3}>THREE.Box3</a> by the way.<br>
                    It internally uses an <a href=${this.collisionDetection}>AABB</a> algo to check wether an object is "touching" another object in 3d or 2d.<br><br>
                    Finally I worked on the treasure chest with its animations and the cube that let's you read those lines.<br><br> 

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Production</p><br>
                    First I tried to optimize the 3d scene as much as possible by lowering texture's quality, limiting shadows, the camera frustrum, etc... <a href=$${this.discoverThreejs}>This tutorial was very useful</a>.<br>
                    To produce a production build of the app I used <a href=${this.webpackLink}>Webpack5</a>. In my configuration it bundles all the JS and minifies the CSS/HTML for better performances.<br>
                    As it's a static web page, it doesn't use any database so <b>Github Pages</b> appeared to be an easy hosting solution for this app.<br><br>

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Challenges</p><br>
                    Almost every part of this project was extremely challenging as I had a very short amount of time to learn Three.js 
                    (<a href=${this.threejsFundamentals}>which I almost entirely did thanks to this amazing tutorial</a>), get in touch with 3d, Blender, animations in which I had almost zero knowledgeâ€¦<br>
                    I'm glad though that I was doing well in math classes in earlier courses because 3d happens to be full of trigonometry <img src=${grinning} alt="grinning">.<br>
                    But I learnt so much from it and understood the very basics of how 3d games are made.<br><br>

                    I haven't been able to keep up with all the challenges as this app is absolutely not a fit for small devices such as mobile phones.
                    I focused only on laptop/desktop devices so responsiveness and performance related issues will probably be encountered.
