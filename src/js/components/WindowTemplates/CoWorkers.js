                    Co-Workers is the result of three weeks of collaborative work.<br>
                    We were asked to improve co-working spaces and our decision was to focus on social networking in order to encourage interactions between users.<br><br>
                    The App includes a help-from-peers system, events, profiles and the possibility to redeem point you gained by being social.

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Work done</p><br>
                    We started by developping the html/css theme with <b>Bootstrap Studio</b> which I found to be very nice if you like using <b>Bootstrap</b> for your projects.<br>
                    It's indeed a sort of <b>WYSIWYG</b> software focus on the <b>Bootstrap CSS framework</b> and it really allowed us to have something to deliver very quickly.<br><br>
                    Then we just had to transform the theme into react components and create a <b>Redux</b> store for app level state management.<br><br>

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Features</p><br>
                    One of the main feature of the app is the <a href="#${this.id}-slide-1">interactive, real-time, responsive map</a> which displays position of present users inside the co-working space.<br>
                    This map was an essential feature of our app and it provided data about each user in the co-working space: their activity, the room they are in, their mood, etcâ€¦<br><br>
                    We also developed a very complete <a href="#${this.id}-slide-1">filtering system</a> for viewing only specific types of users. A user could for instance see only the available lawyers or computer scientists in their friend list ! 
                    To encourage interactions between co-workers we also had a "help request" button that would immediately send a notif to all concerned users.<br><br>
                    Users have <a href="#${this.id}-slide-1">recommendations</a> based on their profile and the rooms busyness.<br><br>
                    By helping others a user can receive points to redeem and also have their skills recommended on LinkedIn.

                    All of these features were only possible with a solid back end <b>API</b> that we tested with <b>Postman</b>.<br>
                    For that, we used <b>NodeJs</b> coupled with <b>Mongoose ORM</b> to handle the <b>MongoDB</b> Database requests.
                    The API is <b>RESTful</b> and securized as we implemented the <b>OAuth2</b> protocol. 
                    Actually it was a mix between RESTful and <b>WebSockets</b> API because we used web sockets to push notifications, mesages, help-requests instantly to concerned users.
                    We used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws">ws</a>, a super light-weight and fast js library for web sockets connection.<br><br>
                    Along with this API, we also had a face recognition web service in <b>Flask</b> (Python) and on-board code for <b>raspberry pis</b>.<br>
                    Although, the Node API was the central node (no pun intended) between our <b>IoT devices</b>, the face reco web service and the web app.
